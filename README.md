AGROROVER WITH IOT
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	Inefficient and Labor-intensive Agricultural practices
	Environmental concerns
The main reason to develop this product is to make an automation robot which will be abel to do the soil test using the NPK sensor and test the fertility of the soil and give the prediction of crop can be cultivated easily and perform few farming techniques with automation.
PROBLEM VALIDATION:
The problem we are trying to solve is a real time working project which will be significant and eco friendly in nature and the cost of the project will be low which means it can be installed easily by the farmers to their vehicles for else it will be medium for the manufacturing of the complete robot.
EXISTING SOLUTIONS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS:
The existing solutions which are used by the farmers are
	Sprinkler Irrigation
	Drip Irrigation
	Weather-Based Irrigation Controllers
PROPOSED SOLUTON:
	The basic goal of the project is to develop a robotics system that will intelligently harvest the crops.
	The NPK sensor attached to our rover helps us to know which nutrient is being lacked by the soil for the healthy growth of the crops.  
	This rover has more than one function, which makes it much more efficient to harvest crops like: - 
1.	Ploughing
2.	Irrigation
3.	Weed Cutting 
	This system is also connected to the internet which will provide the information of level of nutrients should be present at the ground so that the plant could grow healthy.
	By this system we can dissolve and sprinkle the nutrients form the pipe if the level nutrients is too low in the soil. 
	The system leverages the Internet of Things (IoT), crop canopy sensors, and soil moisture sensors to create a comprehensive and intelligent irrigation management solution.  
	We create a platform for the IT freelancers where they are used to operate the rover and they will be given a task to the person where thy should operate and identify the problem in the rover 
SOLUTION AND ITS UNIQUENESS:
	Smart irrigation systems deliver the right amount of water at the right time, significantly reducing water waste.
	This system also assists to provide the healthy growth of the crop
	 Automation reduces the need for manual intervention and labour, saving time for farmers and property managers.
	Sensors ensure that plants receive optimal water levels, improving growth and yield.
	It uses IT freelancers so we can provide the faster and advanced technology to the farmers with less cost.
	It uses app to connect with the farmers and suggest them a crop for better yield and good production .
