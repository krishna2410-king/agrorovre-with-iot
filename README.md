## **Problem Statement**

Current agricultural practices are often inefficient, labour-intensive, and lack precision in resource management. Farmers face challenges in determining soil nutrient levels, selecting suitable crops, and performing essential farming tasks efficiently. This leads to lower yields, higher costs, and environmental concerns such as water wastage and soil degradation.

## **Solution We Provide**

We propose **AgroRover with IoT**, a multifunctional agricultural robot equipped with:

* **NPK Sensor** to test soil fertility and identify nutrient deficiencies.
* **Ploughing, irrigation, and weed-cutting capabilities** to automate farming tasks.
* **IoT connectivity** for real-time nutrient, soil moisture, and crop canopy monitoring.
* **Nutrient dispensing system** to add missing nutrients directly into the soil.
* **Mobile app integration** to guide farmers with crop recommendations and connect with IT freelancers for rover operation and diagnostics.

This solution improves efficiency, reduces labour, saves water, and promotes sustainable farming at a low cost.

## **Equipment Required**

* AgroRover base (robot chassis with motors)
* NPK Soil Sensor
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* Crop Canopy Sensor
* Water Pump & Irrigation Pipes
* Weed Cutter Attachment
* Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32)
* Motor Driver Module
* IoT Module (ESP8266/ESP32 with Wi-Fi)
* Power Supply (Battery Pack)

## **Step-by-Step Connection**

1. **Power off** the rover’s control board.
2. **Connect sensors**:

   * NPK Sensor → Microcontroller analog/digital pins.
   * Soil Moisture Sensor → Analog pin.
   * Crop Canopy Sensor → Analog/Digital pin.
3. **Connect motor driver** to microcontroller (for rover movement).
4. **Attach irrigation pump** to a relay module controlled by the microcontroller.
5. **Connect nutrient dispensing system** motor to another relay/motor driver.
6. **Link IoT module (ESP8266/ESP32)** to microcontroller for cloud communication.
7. **Power up** the system with the battery pack.
8. **Upload the control program** to microcontroller (includes sensor reading, motor control, and IoT data upload).
9. **Test connections** by running each component individually.
10. **Integrate with mobile app** for remote monitoring and operation.
